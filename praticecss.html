    <h1>✨Welcome to my very first CSS website✨</h1>
    <p class="firstclass">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of
        a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or
        XHTML).[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>
    <p class="firstclass">CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout,
        colors, and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in
        the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying
        the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and
        enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
        formatting.</p>
    <p class="firstclass">Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in
        different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based
        browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
        the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
