        <p class="center" id="kuddus">CSS: Cascading Style Sheets</p>
        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
            written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).[1]
            CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]</p>
        <p>CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3]
            This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
            of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant
            CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
            the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its
            formatting.</p>
        <p>Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different
            styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or
            screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the
            content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]</p>
        Types of CSS:<ul>
            <li style="color: green;">Inline</li>
            <li style="color: red;">Internal</li>
            <li style="color: blue;">External</li>
        </ul>
